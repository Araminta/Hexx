This file is organized in layers. To view layers in Maya, choose the Channel Box/Layer Editor icon in the very top right corner of your Maya window. This will open your layer window on the right-hand side of the screen. The layers included in this file are the 5 Standard female shapes + 1 Default female shape (Ruth), the 5 Standard male shapes + 1 Default male shape, the avatar weights source (this avatar has accurate default weights which can be copied to any of your garments/objects), the Skeleton (which you can rig your objects to), and the Avatar layer.  The "Avatar" layer is for export purposes only. After you select your garment/object, you should shift select the "Avatar" and then shift select the skeleton to export successfully.
